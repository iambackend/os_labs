	For tests I copied file of size about 1,6MB. If I used bigger files nothing
would changed, because size is significantly bigger than buffer size in program.
If it was realy small file, than results will be better, but not so interesting,
because in cases with big buffer size whole file will be copied with just one
operation.
	Results:

	As you can see, with small buffer size time required for coping is almost
lineary depends on buffer size, because I/O operations is very time consuming.
But with bigger buffer size time number of I/O operations gets so small, so 
buffer size don't affect computation time much.
	Turned on syncronisation makes program about 10 times slower in almost all
cases, because there is no bufffer on lower level used and each I/O call
causes 'real' I/O operation. But, with big buffer size this effect not so
significant because all our I/O operations have so many bytes inside, so lower
level buffer fully fills almost after each call.
