	Physical address is actual place in physical memory, thus set of physical
addresses is limited by size of physical memory. Virtual address is partialy
hardware, partialy software abstraction layer over physical memory and discs,
which allow to use more space than actually exist in memory, by swapping rarely
used fragments of memory to discs. Also it is allow to use physical memory more
efficent because there is no need in looking for big consecutive chunk of 
space.
