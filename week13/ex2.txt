When recovery strategy is good:
	When operating system is not very sophisticated and deadlocks rarely occur,
	so we can just ignore such possibility, unless it is alredy happend. For
	example, it can be some simple cellphone OS, where not so much resources, processes and system is mainly I/O bound. 
When prevention strategy is good:
	When system is short on resources and deadlocks occur often, so it is better 
	stay in safe states. For example, high loaded server.
When avoidance strategy is good:
	When system is specificaly designed for some tasks and it's not so hard for
	us to just add some additional restrictions on it, like requestion all
	resources on start. For example, some military or space equipment, or 
	household appliances.
