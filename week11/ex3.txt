	Since default buffering mode for stdout is line buffering, buffer cleans
only after newline character is put into buffer.
	For example in program 1 we put "Hello" in a buffer, then we call fork(),
so after that we have two processes with same "Hello" in a buffer. And then
both of this processes put newline character in a buffer and by that trigger
printing of two "Hello" strings.
	In program 2 before fork we put in a buffer a newline character, so buffer
is already empty when we call fork(). Because of this we get one "Hello" and 
two empty strings.
